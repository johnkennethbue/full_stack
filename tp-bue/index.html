  <h5 id="third-div-text">
   Keanu Reeves was born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, 
   and was raised in Toronto, Canada. 
   He first gained attention for his performance in River's Edge, 
   while the comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel, 
   Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, brought him major recognition. 
   Reeves has developed an eclectic film roster that includes 
   the action flick Speed and the sci-fi blockbusters The Matrix and its sequels, 
   as well as more art-house fare like My Own Private Idaho and 
   The Private Lives of Pippa Lee. Reeves made his directorial 
   debut in 2013 with Man of Tai Chi.
